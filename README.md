#Features

#Instructions

1. Download and unzip the .zip file or clone the repo.

Note: If your application edits features in a feature service, contains secure services or web maps that aren't shared publicly or generates requests that exceed 200 characters you may need to setup and use a proxy page. Common situations where you may exceed the URL length are using complex polygons as input to a task or specifying a spatial reference using well-known text (WKT). For details on installing and configuring a proxy page see [Using a proxy page](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/ags_proxy.html).
